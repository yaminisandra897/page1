      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p> Hey, im your friendly neighbourhood spiderman... haha just kidding. Im like a med school dropout and now im on my way into the world of technology. I was born in this beautiful hill town called tirupati. I did all my schooling here. I've been here my whole life. Two years earlier i expanded my wings anf flew off to china to study my then dream subject, medicine. It was hard, but i tried and failed. I came back and now im on the pursite to happyness. i miss my friends back in china and my dorm.Its nice being back in tirupati, ive got new friends in the gym now, i still see my old friends regularly. </p>

        <h3>SPORTS</h3>
        <p>So i might not seem like a person who plays sports but believe me when i say i have a mean forehand.ive played tennis for like 6-7 years. i love the sport very much. its agressive,competitive, not to mention hard to master. thats why i
          like it. i would be up anytime for a rally or a match or two if youre into it.</p>
